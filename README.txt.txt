In view of the fact that one of the links - http://samples.databoom.space/api1/sampledb/collections/allobjects, given to us in the current task was impossible to use
(because additional client authentication was required to access this part of server data (needed credentials: password and login), 
an identical link was found - http://samples.databoom.space/api1/sandboxdb/collections/allobjects, only with a full list of permissions and the ability to change data.
